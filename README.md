# Digit-classification-
This project demonstrates how to build and train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The code is implemented in a Google Colab notebook and utilizes popular Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
